# js-translateX-slider
This project was a personal one where I tried to demonstrate a good level of understanding of Native JS while trying to achieve a 'slider' affect by manipulating the CSS transform function 'translateX'. I wanted to see if I could achieve a basic slider effect.

Visit https://manojkumar44.github.io/js-translateX-slider/ to see it in action.
Note: Needs tweaking, has a known bug where sometimes when the dom is loaded the translateX doesn't function correctly. To remedy this simply refresh the browser a few times and try again.
